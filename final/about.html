                <header>JavaScript and Java</header>

                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                    checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                    control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based
                    object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited
                    can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special
                    declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                    methods. </p>
                <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                    variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
                    public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed. </p>
